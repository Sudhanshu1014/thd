In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, organizations rely heavily on complex software systems to support their business operations. At Sojo, a company specializing in CRM and sales queue solutions, the absence of an effective log monitoring system has led to significant operational challenges. Currently, the company faces delays in identifying and resolving system issues, resulting in a reactive approach where clients report errors before the technical team is even aware of them. This not only impacts customer satisfaction but also hinders the efficiency of the development team, as developers have to manually search through extensive logs to pinpoint issues within specific software components.  

To address these challenges, there is a need to develop a robust log classification system as a precursor to a comprehensive log monitoring solution, akin to industry-leading tools like Splunk.

### Proposed Solution Architecture:  

The log classification system will utilize a multi-stage classification pipeline, as illustrated in the diagram:  

1. **Regex Classification:**  
   - Initially, incoming log messages will be processed using regular expressions for basic classification. This will help quickly categorize known patterns into valid classes.  
   - If the log does not match any predefined pattern, it is marked as "Unknown."  

2. **Handling Unknown Classes:**  
   - **If Enough Training Samples are Available:**  
     - The system will utilize **BERT Classification** to learn from historical data and accurately classify the logs. BERT's contextual understanding enables effective categorization even with complex log messages.  
   - **If Not Enough Training Samples are Available:**  
     - The system will leverage **LLM Classification** (Large Language Model Classification) to dynamically categorize logs by utilizing contextual knowledge from pre-trained language models.  

This hybrid approach balances the efficiency of regex-based classification with the adaptability of modern NLP models like BERT and LLMs, ensuring accurate and scalable log classification.

### Objectives:  
1. **Automated Log Classification:** Automatically categorize logs into predefined categories (e.g., errors, warnings, informational messages) to facilitate quicker analysis and resolution.  
2. **Real-Time Log Analysis:** Enable real-time monitoring and classification to proactively identify issues before they escalate and impact clients.  
3. **Efficient Error Detection:** Reduce the time taken for developers to identify and isolate errors by providing organized and searchable log data.  
4. **Improved Incident Response:** Enable faster incident response times by notifying the relevant teams as soon as an issue is detected.  
5. **Scalable Solution:** Build a scalable log classification system that can handle large volumes of logs generated by Sojo's CRM and sales queue systems.

### Expected Outcomes:  
- Enhanced operational efficiency by transitioning from a reactive to a proactive incident management approach.  
- Reduced client-reported issues due to timely error detection and resolution.  
- Improved productivity of the development team by minimizing manual log searches.  
- Increased customer satisfaction through quicker issue resolution and system reliability.  

This log classification system will lay the foundation for an advanced log monitoring solution, ensuring that Sojo can maintain high operational standards and deliver exceptional customer experiences.
